# Artwork-appraisal-prediction
An art appraisal is an estimate of the value of an artwork. 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of artwork. The model will be trained on a dataset of past artwork sales and will use features such as the the artwork's dimensions, materials used, estimate price range, auction location, auction day, month and year.
