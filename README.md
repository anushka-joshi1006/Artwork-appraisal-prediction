# Artwork-appraisal-prediction
An art appraisal is an estimate of the value of an artwork. 
The objective of this proposal is to develop a deep learning model to predict the price of artwork. The model will be trained on a dataset of past artwork sales and will use features such as the artist's name, the artwork's dimensions, and the medium used to create the artwork.
